When a user enters our app, seamless authentication becomes the key to their personalized experience. Using the power of [Google OAuth2](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2), we establish user identity efficiently.

After a successfull log in, Google OAuth2 provides a unique identifier called `token_id` â€“ think of it as their digital fingerprint. This `token_id` becomes crucial for Okto wallet authentication and, if needed, for creating new wallets.

Let's get coding and see how we can use the `token_id` and [`authenticate`](/sdk-reference/authenticate) to authenticate with Okto.
> Note: if you just want to test and see how it works, you can use the [following steps](/oauth-steps) to get a `token_id` and go directly to the [Authenticate with Okto](#authenticate-with-okto) section.

<Steps>
### Setup Google Sign-In
We will first set up the Google Sign-In library in our project. This involves installing the [@react-native-google-signin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-google-signin/google-signin) package and configuring it.
<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash filename="bash" copy
        pnpm i @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash filename="bash" copy
        npm i @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
        ```bash filename="bash" copy
        yarn add @react-native-google-signin/google-signin
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Now we need to configure Google. Now, we will need a web `client id` which if you don't have, you can use the [following steps](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en) to get one.
Once you have the `client id` we can configure the Google Sign-In library.
```tsx filename="screens/login.tsx"
import { GoogleSignin } from "@react-native-google-signin/google-signin";

const webClientId = "YOUR_WEB_CLIENT_ID";
GoogleSignin.configure({
    // Update scopes as needed in your app
    scopes: ["email", "profile"],
    webClientId
});
```

### Handle Google Sign-In
Now that we have set up the Google Sign-In library, let's handle the sign-in process. Create a new screen and name it `login.tsx`. In this file, create a function to handle the Google Sign-In process, and call this function when the user presses a button.

```tsx filename="screens/login.tsx" copy
import { GoogleSignin } from "@react-native-google-signin/google-signin";
import { Text, Pressable } from "react-native";

...

const LoginScreen = () => {

    async function handleGoogleSignIn() {
        try {
            await GoogleSignin.hasPlayServices();
            const response = await GoogleSignin.signIn();

            const { idToken } = response;
    
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("Something went wrong. Please try again");
        }
    }

    return (
        <Pressable onPress={handleGoogleSignIn}>
            <Text>Connect with Google</Text>
        </Pressable>
    );
};
```


### Authenticate with Okto
Now that we have obtained the `idToken` from Google, we can use it to authenticate with Okto. Utilize the [`authenticate`](/sdk-reference/authenticate) function from the SDK to perform authentication with Okto.
> Note: The `idToken` expires in 30 minutes, so it is recommended to authenticate with Okto as soon as possible after obtaining the `idToken`, or the [`authenticate`](/sdk-reference/authenticate) process will fail.

```tsx filename="screens/login.tsx" copy
import {
  useOkto,
  type OktoContextType,
} from 'okto-sdk-react-native';
...

const LoginScreen = () => {
    const { authenticate } = useOkto() as OktoContextType;
    
    ...

    async const handleGoogleSignIn(){
        try {
            ...
            const { idToken } = response;
            authenticate(idToken, (result, error) => {
                if (result) {
                    console.log('authentication successful');
                }
                if (error) {
                    console.error('authentication error:', error);
                }
            });
        } catch (error) {
            console.log("Something went wrong. Please try again");
        }
    }
}
```
#### Existing user
If the user already has an Okto wallet, the `result` will contain the authentication status

#### New user
If the user does not have an Okto wallet, they will get a UI prompt to [create a new wallet](/guide/authenticate/create-wallet.mdx).

After a successful authentication, the `result` will contain the authentication status. You can use this information to determine if the user has authenticated or not.
</Steps>

Great! With that, you have successfully authenticated with Okto using Google Sign-In.
