    3. Choose "Android" as the application type.
    4. In the "Package name" field, enter the package name of your Android app (e.g., `com.example.myapp`).
    5. In the "SHA-1 certificate fingerprint" field, enter the SHA-1 fingerprint of your signing certificate. You can obtain this fingerprint using keytool or Android Studio. You can use the follwing command to get the fingerprint using keytool
    ```bash
    keytool -keystore ./android/app/debug.keystore -list -v
    ```
    6. Click "Create" to generate your Android client ID.
    7. Copy the client ID provided.

    <div style={{ width: "80%" }}>
        ![Android Client](/google-auth/create-android-clientid.png)
    </div>

    ### Creating a Web Client ID

    1. Navigate to the "Credentials" page under "APIs & Services" in Google Cloud Console.
    2. Click on "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
    3. Choose "Web application" as the application type.
    4. Click "Create" to generate your web client ID.
    5. Copy the client ID and client secret provided.

        ![Android Client](/google-auth/create-web-clientid.png)
    </div>

    ### Creating an iOS Client ID

    1. In Google Cloud Console, navigate to the "Credentials" page under "APIs & Services".
    2. Click on "Create credentials" and select "OAuth client ID".
    3. Choose "iOS" as the application type.

    <div style={{ width: "80%" }}>
        ![iOS Client](/google-auth/create-ios-clientid.png)
    </div>

    

    ### Conclusion

    You have successfully set up a project in Google Console, created an OAuth consent screen, and generated web, Android & iOS client IDs for Google authentication. You can now integrate Google authentication into Android/iOS applications using the provided client IDs.
