We will now start building an app using Okto and its methods. 
But before we begin exploring, we have included some setup steps that might seem familiar, but rest assured, they're not needed for the SDK, but they will help us in creating a better app. 
So, feel free to glance over those steps, since our main focus is on the features of Okto.

Let's get started with the setup.

  <Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ“±">
    We have a react native sample app integrated with Okto SDK that you can use as a starting point. You can find it [here](https://github.com/okto-hq/okto-sdk-rn-sample) 
</Callout>
    <Steps>
        ### Install required packages
        First, let's install the necessary packages for navigation and screens. We will use `@react-navigation/native`. You can check the installation guide [here](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started). We will also be using `react-native-dropdown` for the dropdown component.
        <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
            <Tabs.Tab>
                ```bash filename="bash" copy
                pnpm i @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-dropdown-picker
                ```
            </Tabs.Tab>
            <Tabs.Tab>
                ```bash filename="bash" copy
                npm i @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-dropdown-picker
                ```
            </Tabs.Tab>
            <Tabs.Tab>
                ```bash filename="bash" copy
                yarn add @react-navigation/native react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context react-native-dropdown-picker
                ```
            </Tabs.Tab>
        </Tabs>

        ### Setup Navigation
        We will start by creating a file named `navigation.tsx` in the root of the project. Then, we will add a stack navigator as shown below.

        ```tsx filename="navigation.tsx" copy
        import { createNativeStackNavigator } from 'react-native-screens/native-stack';

        const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator();

        export default function Navigation() {
            return (
                <Stack.Navigator>
                    // Add screens here
                </Stack.Navigator>
            );
        }
        ```
        Import the `Navigation` component into `App.tsx` and wrap it with `NavigationContainer` from `@react-navigation/native`.

        ```tsx filename="App.tsx" copy
        import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
        import Navigation from './navigation';

        ...

        export default function App() {
            return (
                <NavigationContainer>
                    <Navigation />
                </NavigationContainer>
            );
        }
        ```

        ### Setup Screens
        Next, create a dummy screen for navigation testing. Make a new folder named `screens` at the project's root and create a file named `HomeScreen.tsx` inside this folder.
        
        ```tsx filename="HomeScreen.tsx" copy
        import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

        const HomeScreen = () => {
            return (
                <View style={{ flex: 1, justifyContent: 'center', alignItems: 'center' }}>
                    <Text>Home Screen</Text>
                </View>
            );
        }

        export default HomeScreen;
        ```

        Add the `HomeScreen` component in `navigation.tsx` and integrate it into the stack navigator.
        ```tsx filename="navigation.tsx" copy
        import HomeScreen from './screens/HomeScreen';

        export default function Navigation(){
            return (
                <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="Home">
                    <Stack.Screen name="Home" component={HomeScreen} />
                </Stack.Navigator>
            )
        }
        ```

        From any screen, you can navigate to the `HomeScreen` using `navigation.navigate("Home")`.

        Great! With that, the setup is complete. You can now start building the app with Okto. ðŸš€

        ### Setup Screens
        Create a dummy screen for navigation testing. Make a new folder named `screens` inside the `lib` folder and create a file named `home_screen.dart` inside this folder.
        
        ```dart filename="home_screen.dart" copy
        import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

        class HomeScreen extends StatelessWidget {
          @override
          Widget build(BuildContext context) {
            return Scaffold(
              appBar: AppBar(
                title: Text('Home Screen'),
              ),
              body: Center(
                child: Text('Home Screen'),
              ),
            );
          }
        }
        ```

        Great! With that, the setup is complete. You can now start building the app with Okto. ðŸš€
